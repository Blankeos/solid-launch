> An sophisticated boiler-plate built for **simplicity**.

[Carlo](https://carlo.vercel.app/)'s starter for making a Vike + Solid app with batteries included on stuff I like after experimenting for years.

This is handcrafted from my own research. This might not work for you, but it works for me. ü§ì

### Benefits

- [x] üê≠ **Handcrafted and minimal** - picked and chose "do one thing, do it well" libraries that are just enough to get the job done. Just looks a bit bloated at a glance. (I kinda made my own NextJS from scatch here)
- [x] ‚ö°Ô∏è **Super-fast dev server** - way faster than NextJS thanks to Vite. You need to feel it to believe it!
- [x] üí® **Fast, efficient, fine-grained Reactivity** - thanks to Solid, it's possibly the most enjoyable framework I used that uses JSX. Has state management primitives out-of-the-box and keeps the experience a breeze.
- [x] üêç **Extremely customizable** - you're not at the mercy of limited APIs and paradigms set by big frameworks or third-party services. Swap with your preferred JS backend framework/runtime if you want. Vike is just a middleware. Most of the tech I use here are open-source and roll-your-own type of thing. Hack it up! You're a dev aren't you?
- [x] ‚òÅÔ∏è **Selfhost-ready** - Crafted with simple hosting in mind that'll still probably scale to millions. Just spin up Docker container on a good'ol VPS without locking into serverless. DHH and Shayan influenced me on this. You can still host it on serverless tho. I think? lol
- [x] **üîã Batteries-included** - took care of the hard stuff for you. A well-thought-out folder structure from years of making projects: a design system, components, utilities, hooks, constants, an adequate backend DDD-inspired sliced architecture that isn't overkill, dockerizing your app, and most importantly---perfectly-crafted those pesky config files.

### Tech Stack

- [x] **SolidJS** - Frontend framework that I like. Pretty underrated, but awesome!
- [x] **Vike** - Like NextJS, but just a middleware. SSR library on-top of Vite. Use on any JS backend. Flexible, Simple, and Fast!
- [x] **Hono** - 2nd fastest Bun framework(?), run anywhere, uses easy-to-understand web-standard paradigms.
- [x] **tRPC** - E2E typesafety without context switching. Just amazing DevX.
- [x] **Tailwind** - Styling the web has been pretty pleasant with it. I even use it on React Native for work. It's amazing.
- [ ] **Prisma** - Simple, battle-tested ORM (TBD)
- [ ] **Database**
  - [ ] **Kysely** - SQL-like queries without perf drawbacks. (TBD)
  - [ ] **SQLite (Turso)** - easy to dev database. (TBD)
  - [ ] **CockroachDB** - serverless database. (TBD)
  - [ ] **MongoDB** - cheap easy to use database. (TBD)
- [ ] **Lucia** - Makes self-rolling auth easy.
- [ ] **Emails** - SES or MimePost.
- [ ] **S3** - Blob object storage.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
